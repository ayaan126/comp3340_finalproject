    <h1>About Digital Novels</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Digital Novels</strong> is an innovative online bookstore dedicated to providing a 
        wide range of eBooks, audiobooks, and printed novels to readers around the world. 
        Our mission is to make literature accessible and convenient for everyone, 
        whether you enjoy reading on your tablet, smartphone, or prefer a traditional 
        hardcover book.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Business Case</h2>
    <p>
        This project was developed as part of a web development course at the 
        <strong>University of Windsor</strong>. Digital Novels demonstrates a 
        fully functional online store using modern web technologies such as 
        <strong>PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript</strong>. 
        The website includes both a <em>user interface</em> and an <em>admin interface</em>, 
        providing a complete e-commerce solution with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Product catalog with over 20 books</li>
        <li>Dynamic product options (cover types, languages)</li>
        <li>Shopping cart and order history</li>
        <li>Admin dashboard for managing books and users</li>
        <li>Responsive design for desktop and mobile</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of Digital Novels is to simulate a real-world e-commerce bookstore 
        where users can explore, purchase, and track their orders while administrators 
        can monitor the catalog and website health.
